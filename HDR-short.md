# HDR Human and Digital Rights Declaration
*A Common Sense™ Statement for Consumers, Governments, and Companies*

## Preamble
In the digital age, our lives, work, and property increasingly exist as data, software, and online services. Digital rights must be treated as real rights—ownership, consent, and fairness should apply equally online and offline.

## 10 Core Digital Rights

1. **Right to Evidence Transparency**  
   - Policies restricting digital rights must be based on clear, verifiable, unbiased evidence.  
   - Users deserve the ability to challenge decisions impacting their digital lives.

2. **Right to True Ownership of Digital Goods**  
   - If you pay for it, you own it; companies cannot arbitrarily revoke access or “brick” your property.  
   - Digital ownership protections should mirror those of physical goods.

3. **Right to Fair and Transparent Digital Contracts**  
   - Terms must be clear, provided before purchase, and not changed mid-term without explicit consent.  

4. **Right to Meaningful Consent for Data Use**  
   - Data collection, tracking, AI training, and profiling require explicit, informed, *opt-in* consent.  
   - Consent must be revocable without penalty.  
   - **Any data retention must also be opt-in, clearly disclosed, and limited to reasonable timeframes.**

5. **Right to Freedom from Arbitrary Censorship**  
   - Content restrictions must be transparent, justified, and appealable.  
   - Blanket bans based on vague standards or AI profiling are unacceptable.

6. **Right to Control Your Digital Presence**  
   - Users must be able to access, modify, or delete their data and accounts without coercion or “dark patterns.”

7. **Right to Opt-In, Not Opt-Out**  
   - Sensitive or potentially harmful digital practices—including biometrics, tracking, data sharing, retention, and automated restrictions—must require explicit opt-in consent.  
   - Negative or harmful actions that limit, remove, or damage a user’s rights, experience, or safety **must never be forced or disguised as opt-out.**

8. **Right to Protection from Deceptive Practices**  
   - Companies may not use coercion, manipulation, or forced surveillance to control user choices.  
   - Users must be protected from systems that automatically opt them into harmful or limiting settings.

9. **Special Protections for Vulnerable Individuals**  
   - Privacy and stability are critical for activists, marginalized creators, and those facing health or safety risks.

10. **Principle of Digital Fairness**  
    - Digital does not mean diminished rights—governments, companies, and platforms must uphold the same protections online as in the physical world.
