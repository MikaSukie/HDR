# HDR Human and Digital Rights Document
A Common Sense™ document for consumers, governments, and companies.

## Preamble

In today’s digital world, our interactions, creations, and possessions increasingly exist as data, software, and online services. This transition requires new understandings about what it means to **own**, **control**, and **consent** to digital goods and contracts.

This document defines the fundamental rights and protections every user, minor or adult, should have regarding digital products, platforms, and agreements. These rights are grounded in common sense and fairness, recognizing that digital does not mean “less real” or “less owned.”

## Evidence Transparency and Accountability

- Governments, companies, and platforms must provide clear, verifiable sources for all data and claims used to justify policies restricting digital rights.  
- Statements about “harm,” “risk,” “safety,” or “exposure” must include context about user agency, consent, and the nature of content engagement.  
- Policies based on unverified, biased, or incomplete data undermine public trust and violate fairness.  
- Users deserve transparency and balanced information to understand and challenge decisions impacting their digital lives.

---

## Universal Requirement for Evidence Transparency in Lawmaking and Enforcement

- The principles of evidence transparency and accountability must apply equally to all laws, regulations, and enforcement actions, digital or physical.  
- Laws such as KOSA, the Online Safety Act, and others with real-world enforcement consequences must be based on clear, verifiable, and balanced evidence.  
- Without such standards, laws risk becoming instruments of unchecked power, violating citizens’ rights and undermining public trust.

## What Must Be Opt-In (Never Opt-Out)

Certain digital practices are so sensitive, harmful, or impactful that **explicit, informed opt-in consent is mandatory.**  
Default opt-out or implied consent is **never acceptable**, especially for actions that **remove rights, reduce access, or harm the user’s autonomy**.

Opt-in is required for:

- **Personal data collection and processing**, including tracking, profiling, behavioral advertising, or biometric analysis.  
- **Data retention** beyond immediate service function ,  retention must be **opt-in only**, **time-limited**, and **proportionate**.  
- **Use of cookies or similar tracking technologies** beyond necessary technical functions.  
- **Subscription or paid service enrollment**, no automatic or hidden sign-ups.  
- **Third-party data sharing or affiliate transfers.**  
- **Automated decision-making or AI profiling** that affects access, restrictions, or visibility.  
- **Location tracking and device sensor access (camera, microphone, GPS).**  
- **Collection or use of user-generated content and data (art, text, voice, logs) for AI training or algorithm development.**

Users must be clearly informed *before* consenting, using simple and transparent language.  
They must retain the right to withdraw consent **at any time** without penalty or retaliation.

## 1. Right to True Ownership of Digital Goods

- When users purchase digital products, they must **own** what they pay for, not receive a revocable license.  
- Companies must not “brick,” disable, or revoke legitimate access without due cause or explicit, prior consent.  
- Digital ownership must mirror physical ownership protections.

**Legal references:**  
- EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU); UK Consumer Rights Act 2015; Australian Consumer Law.

---

## 2. Right to Fair and Transparent Digital Contracts

- Contracts must be clear, visible before purchase, and not altered mid-term without consent.  
- Users must have the right to fixed-term agreements without sudden price changes or term revisions.  
- Unilateral changes violate consumer protections and trust.

**Legal references:**  
- UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, EU Directive 93/13/EEC, Australian Consumer Law.

## 3. Right to Meaningful Consent for Data and Surveillance

- Data collection, retention, or surveillance requires explicit, informed, **opt-in consent**.  
- Adults may revoke or modify consent without penalty.  
- Minors aged 14–17 should be recognized as capable of meaningful consent.  
- Blanket restrictions justified as “protection” undermine autonomy and self-determination.  
- **All data retention must be strictly opt-in, minimal, and time-limited.**

---

## 4. Right to Freedom from Arbitrary Censorship

- Content restrictions must be transparent, justified, and appealable.  
- Blanket bans or automated moderation without clear reasoning erode expression and trust.  
- AI profiling or vague “standards” cannot replace human accountability.

---

## 5. Right to Control Digital Presence and Data

- Users must be able to access, download, modify, or delete their data and accounts freely.  
- Manipulative “dark patterns” preventing account deletion or forcing consent are prohibited.  
- Users control their digital footprint ,  not corporations.

---

## 6. Right to Protection from Deceptive or Coercive Practices

- Companies may **not** use deception, coercion, or manipulation to extract data or consent.  
- No feature that removes or damages a user’s rights may be enabled by default ,  **harmful or restrictive actions must be opt-in** only.  
- Blocking privacy tools like VPNs, ad blockers, or proxies violates user rights.  
- Forced data collection, consent fatigue, and manipulative “accept to continue” systems are prohibited.  
- No retroactive or hidden consent changes may be used to coerce continued participation.  
- **Threats to delete, restrict, or suspend accounts to force consent are digital coercion and forbidden.**

## 7. Special Protections for Vulnerable Individuals

Unfair practices and invasive tracking disproportionately harm those with disabilities, mental health conditions, or marginalized identities.  
Privacy and autonomy protections are essential to preserve their safety, expression, and livelihoods.

---

## Conclusion

The digital ecosystem must uphold **ownership**, **consent**, **transparency**, and **fairness** with equal or greater strength than in the physical world.  
Digital does not mean diminished autonomy.  
Governments, companies, and platforms must recognize and uphold these principles in both law and design.
